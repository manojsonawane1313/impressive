            <p>Foam Wall Putty is an innovative, lightweight wall finishing compound designed to provide a smooth and
                durable surface on interior walls and ceilings. Combining the benefits of traditional putty with the

                walls. Its foam-like consistency allows for easy application and spreading, while providing excellent
                adhesion and a strong, lasting finish. Foam Wall Putty is perfect for preparing surfaces before
                painting, ensuring a flawless final look.</p>

                    and loose material. Remove any flaking paint or deteriorated material from the application area.

                    finishes. Follow the paint manufacturer's instructions for best results.</li>
