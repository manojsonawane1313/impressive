            <p>Epoxy Putty is a powerful, versatile repair compound designed for a wide range of applications. Known for
                its exceptional bonding strength and durability, Epoxy Putty can be used to repair, fill, and rebuild
                various materials, including metal, wood, concrete, and plastic. Once mixed, it forms a strong,
                permanent bond that hardens like steel, making it ideal for both structural and cosmetic repairs.
                Whether for home repairs, industrial maintenance, or DIY projects, Epoxy Putty provides a reliable
                solution that lasts.</p>

            <h3>Instructions for Use</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Surface Preparation: </strong>Ensure the surface is clean, dry, and free from rust, grease,
                    dirt, and loose material. Roughen smooth surfaces to enhance adhesion.</li>
                <li><strong>Mixing: </strong>Cut or break off the required amount of epoxy putty. Knead the putty by
                    hand until the color is uniform, indicating that the components are fully mixed.</li>
                <li><strong>Application: </strong> Apply the mixed putty to the repair area within the working time
                    (typically 3-5 minutes). Press firmly to ensure good contact with the surface. Shape or mold as
                    needed before the putty starts to harden.</li>
                <li><strong>Curing: </strong>Allow the putty to cure fully. Depending on the product, full curing may
                    take 1-2 hours, after which the repair will be ready for sanding, drilling, or painting.</li>
                <li><strong>Finishing: </strong>Once cured, the epoxy putty can be sanded, drilled, painted, or machined
                    as needed to achieve the desired finish.</li>
            </ol>
