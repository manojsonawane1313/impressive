                <li><strong>Surface Preparation: </strong>Ensure the surface is clean, dry, and free from dust, grease,
                    and loose material. Remove any flaking paint or deteriorated material before application.</li>

                    smooth, even finish. Remove any sanding dust before proceeding with painting or additional coats.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Painting or Finishing: </strong>After sanding, the surface is ready for painting or other
                    finishes. Follow the paint or wallpaper manufacturer's instructions for the best results.
