            <h2>Elastic Putty</h2>
            <p class="product-price">Price: Rs.00</p> <!-- Update the price -->
            <p>Elastic Putty is a high-performance, flexible compound designed to fill and repair cracks, joints, and
                gaps in various surfaces. Its unique elastic properties allow it to accommodate movement without
                cracking, making it ideal for surfaces that experience frequent expansion and contraction. Elastic Putty
                is perfect for both interior and exterior applications, providing a durable and long-lasting solution
                for a wide range of repair and finishing tasks.</p>

            </ul>

            <h3>Instructions for Use</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Surface Preparation: </strong>Ensure the surface is clean, dry, and free of dust, grease,
                    and loose material. Remove any flaking paint or deteriorated material before application.</li>
                <li><strong>Application: </strong>Apply the Elastic Putty using a putty knife or applicator. Fill the
                    crack, joint, or gap completely, and smooth the surface to blend with the surrounding area.</li>
                <li><strong>Drying and Curing: </strong>Allow the putty to dry and cure fully. Depending on the
                    thickness of the application and environmental conditions, this may take 24-48 hours.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanding (Optional) </strong>If necessary, lightly sand the surface with fine-grit sandpaper
                    to achieve a smooth finish. Ensure the surface is dust-free before painting or finishing.</li>
                <li><strong>Painting or Finishing: </strong>Once fully cured, the Elastic Putty can be painted or
                    finished according to your preferences. Follow the paint or finish manufacturer's instructions for
                    best results.</li>
            </ol>
