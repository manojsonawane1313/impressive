            <p>White cement wall putty is a fine white powder made from white cement and polymers, designed for use on
                plastered walls. It creates a smooth, uniform surface, ready for painting. This product is known for its
                excellent adhesion, moisture resistance, and smooth finish, providing a durable base for the application
                of paints.</p>

            <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High Adhesion: </strong> Adheres strongly to the substrate, preventing the paint from

                    applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Moisture Resistance: </strong> Resists moisture, preventing damage like peeling or dampness.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Durability: </strong> Extends the life of paint by providing a stable base.</li>
                <li><strong>Alkaline Resistance: </strong> Prevents the paint from being affected by the alkalinity of
                    the cement.</li>
                <li><strong>Eco-Friendly: </strong>Non-toxic and environment-friendly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Instructions for Use</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Surface Preparation:</strong> Ensure the wall surface is clean, dry, and free from dust,
                    grease, or loose particles.</li>
                <li><strong>Mixing:</strong> Mix thoroughly to obtain a smooth, lump-free paste. Let it stand for 10
                    minutes, then remix.</li>
                <li><strong>Application:</strong> Apply the first coat of wall putty using a putty knife or trowel, with
                    an even, uniform thickness.</li>
                <li><strong>Finishing:</strong> After the putty has completely dried, the surface can be sanded again to
                    achieve an ultra-smooth finish.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Store the product in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and
                    moisture.</li>
