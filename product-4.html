            <ol>
                <li><strong>Surface Preparation: </strong> Ensure the drywall surface is clean and dry. Remove any dust,
                    grease, or loose material. For joint applications, ensure the drywall tape is properly embedded.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Application: </strong>Apply the joint compound using a taping knife or drywall knife. Fill
                    the joints, seams, and any imperfections with a smooth, even layer. Feather the edges to blend with
                    the surrounding surface.</li>

                    thickness of the application and environmental conditions, typically within 24 hours for a complete
                    dry.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanding: </strong> Once dry, sand the surface with fine-grit sandpaper to achieve a smooth
                    and even finish. Be sure to remove any dust before applying additional coats or paint.</li>
                <li><strong>Additional Coats: </strong>For best results, apply additional coats as needed to achieve a
                    perfect finish, allowing each coat to dry and sanding between coats.</li>
