            <h3>Instructions for Use</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Surface Preparation: </strong>Ensure the surface is clean, dry, and free of dust, grease,
                    and loose material. Remove any existing paint or deteriorated material in the application area.</li>
                <li><strong>Application: </strong>Apply the Waterproof Putty using a putty knife or trowel. Spread the
                    putty evenly over the surface, filling any cracks, holes, or gaps. Smooth the surface to achieve a
                    uniform finish.</li>
                <li><strong>Drying: </strong>Allow the putty to dry completely. Drying time can vary based on the
                    thickness of the application and environmental conditions, typically within 6-8 hours.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanding: </strong>Once dry, lightly sand the surface with fine-grit sandpaper to achieve a
                    smooth, even finish. Make sure to remove any dust before proceeding to the next step.</li>
                <li><strong>Painting or Finishing: </strong>After sanding, the surface is ready for painting or other
                    finishes. Follow the paint manufacturer's instructions to ensure optimal results.</li>
            </ol>
